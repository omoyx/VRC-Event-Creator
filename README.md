## Download
- Releases: https://github.com/Cynacedia/VRC-Event-Creator/releases

## Privacy & Data storage
Your password is not stored. Only session tokens are cached.
The app stores its files in the Electron user data directory (shown in the Settings > Application Info section):

- `profiles.json` (profile templates)
- `cache.json` (session tokens)
- `settings.json` (app settings)
- `themes.json` (theme presets and custom colors)
- `pending-events.json` (automation queue)
- `automation-state.json` (automation tracking)

You can override the data directory with the `VRC_EVENT_DATA_DIR` environment variable.
On first launch, the app will try to import an existing `profiles.json` from the project folder.

__**Do not share cache files or application data folders.**__

## Usage notes
- Profiles require a Profile Name, Event Name, and Description before you can continue.
- Private groups can only use Access Type = Group.
- Duration uses DD:HH:MM and caps at 31 days.
- Tags are limited to 5 and languages are limited to 3.
- Gallery uploads are limited to PNG/JPG, 64-2048 px, under 10 MB, and 64 images per account.
- VRChat limits event creation to 10 events per-hour per-person per-group.
- Event automation requires the app to be running. Missed automations can be managed in Modify Events.

## Troubleshooting
- Login issues: delete `cache.json` and sign in again (use the data folder shown in Settings > Application Info).
- Missing groups: your account must have calendar access in the target group.
- Rate limiting: VRChat may rate limit event creation. Wait and retry, and stop if several attempts fail. Do not spam refresh or event creation buttons.
- Updates: Some features are blocked when updates are pending. Download and run the latest release.
